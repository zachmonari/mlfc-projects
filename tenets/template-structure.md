# Tenet: Template Structure Over Implementation Details

*Description*: The template should provide a clear structure and guidance for implementation, but not implement the actual data science work. Students should understand what to implement and where, without being given complete solutions. This principle ensures the template serves as a learning scaffold rather than a complete solution.

*Quote*: *"Show the path, don't walk it for them."*

*Examples*:
- Provide stub functions with clear docstrings
- Include implementation guides in comments
- Show error handling patterns without implementing specific data sources
- Demonstrate testing approaches with template tests
- Provide clear module structure and organization
- Include example patterns and approaches

*Counter-examples*:
- Implementing complete data loading from specific APIs
- Providing full analysis pipelines
- Including real datasets or complete solutions
- Adding domain-specific implementations
- Giving students complete working code
- Implementing specific business logic

*Conflicts*:
- *Guidance vs Solution*: When providing more examples would help but might be seen as "the answer"
- Resolution: Provide patterns and examples, not complete implementations
- *Clarity vs Completeness*: When more detail would clarify but might provide too much solution
- Resolution: Focus on structure and patterns, let students implement details
