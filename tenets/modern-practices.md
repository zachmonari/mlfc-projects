# Tenet: Modern Python Practices Without Over-Engineering

*Description*: The template should follow current Python best practices and use modern tools, but avoid over-engineering solutions. Students should learn contemporary approaches without being burdened by unnecessary complexity. This ensures they learn current standards while maintaining focus on core concepts.

*Quote*: *"Use the right tool for the job, not every tool in the toolbox."*

*Examples*:
- Use Poetry for dependency management (modern, clear)
- Use pytest for testing (standard, well-documented)
- Use type hints for clarity (helps learning, not just production)
- Use `pyproject.toml` for configuration (current standard)
- Use modern Python packaging standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

*Counter-examples*:
- Adding multiple testing frameworks simultaneously
- Using experimental or unstable features
- Implementing complex CI/CD pipelines in the template
- Adding unnecessary abstractions for "flexibility"
- Using deprecated tools and practices
- Over-engineering simple solutions

*Conflicts*:
- *Simplicity vs Completeness*: When adding more tools would be "better" but more complex
- Resolution: Prefer fewer, well-chosen tools over comprehensive but complex solutions
- *Modern vs Stable*: When newer tools offer benefits but may be less stable
- Resolution: Choose modern tools that are well-established and documented
